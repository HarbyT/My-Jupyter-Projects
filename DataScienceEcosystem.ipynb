    "Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:\n",
    "1. NumPy: NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.  It's a building block for many other data science libraries.   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. pandas: pandas provides data structures like DataFrames, which are essential for data manipulation and analysis. It allows you to easily clean, transform, and explore your data.  It makes working with tabular data much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. scikit-learn: scikit-learn is a comprehensive library for machine learning in Python. It offers a wide range of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and model selection, as well as tools for model evaluation and preprocessing.   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a plotting library that enables you to create static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.  It's crucial for exploring data and communicating results.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Seaborn: Seaborn builds on top of Matplotlib and provides a higher-level interface for creating statistically informative and visually appealing graphics. It simplifies the creation of complex visualizations."
